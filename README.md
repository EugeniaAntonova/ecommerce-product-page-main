## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about classes, separation of concerns, sessionStorage, grid and all. It was a very tough thing for me to work on it alone. It works, but i should deffinetely do it all over in six months and compare.

### Continued development

While coding this challenge I run into so many things I didn`t know, that now it is not very clear what to learn. I just need to learn more JS. Figure out classes, architecture and much more.
